BUG:importobjs.c: triangulate_polygon( ) does not work properly. Some
    LightWave models may get a wee bit mangled...

BUG:menu_cbs.c: highlight_entry( ) does not work after a set_entry_text( )
    (appears to be a bug in GTK+, I've sent in a report)

BUG:menu_cbs.c: Dialogs do not hide properly before viewport is blanked
    (e.g. when generating a lattice, or loading a file. The dialog either
    leaves a lovely grey rectangle on the viewport, or doesn't hide at all
    until too late :P )  Not sure how to fix this.

BUG:menu_cbs.c: Velocity input entry should have automagically inserted
    commas. gtk_entry_set_position( ) isn't cooperating, however :(

TODO: Anyone want to translate lstrings.c? E-mail me if so, I will
appreciate it greatly!

TODO: Note in docs that Lorentz contraction / optical aberration toggles
have no effect on exported SRS file
