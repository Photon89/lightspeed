1.3 (?? July 2001)
------------------

* Project moved to SourceForge.

* Updated documentation (e-mail addresses, links, writing style, etc.)


1.2 (24 April 1999)
-------------------

* Added keybindings for most operations. Those GtkAccelerator functions
really need better documentation.

* Upgraded profiler to calculate framerate using a variable-length
frametime buffer. The fps readout shouldn't fluctuate so wildly anymore on
super-fast hardware.

* Small fix to velocity_entry( ) so that commas are also added when
velocity units are changed.

* Small changes to set_entry_width( ) and some GtkEntry handling.

* Updated gtkgl interface to use the newer API. (Note: compat.h maintains
older GtkGLArea compatibility)

* More configure script fixes.


1.1 (14 April 1999)
-------------------

* Added a vertical slider for velocity control. Thanks go to Stijn Buys
for [being the first to send in] this excellent suggestion!

* Added kilometers/hour velocity units, and removed kilometers/second
(km/s was kind of redundant anyway)

* Moved all language-specific program strings into lstrings.c. Light
Speed! is ready to go international! (Please contact me if you wish to do
translations, I will greatly appreciate it)

* TIFF exporter fixed. (no segfaults! yay!)

* Added heuristic for calculating camera distance when specifying its
position with xyz/angles. This needs field testing; any opinions?

* Remade title.xpm (for the About dialog), toning down the glow a bit.
(you see, I have a *really dark* monitor :-)

* Modified break_transition( ) and related code in transition_engine( ) to
work more efficiently (was causing problems with the velocity slider)

* Exported time-string generation code from infodisp.c to misc.c. This
whole bit is all in time_string( ) now.

* configure script fixes. Test for libpng now leaves off the -lgtkgl; a
few other rough edges filed down too. Should I add a prefix option for
libpng, libtiff, et. al.?


1.0 (4 April 1999)
------------------

* Initial release.
